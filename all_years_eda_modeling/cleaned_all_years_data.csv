Composite endpoints (pain reduction, physical function, and patient global assessment) were deemed suitable due to fibromyalgia being a syndrome with multiple symptoms.

KADIAN has a unique gradual-ascending and gradual-descending plasma profile not shared by other morphine products. Different pellet formulations are used across KADIAN's dosage strengths, affecting drug release.

Therapeutic Implications
FDA’s current standards may allow approval of generics that are not therapeutically equivalent to KADIAN, risking patient safety and efficacy.

Dose-Dumping Risks
Co-ingestion with alcohol could cause uncontrolled drug release.
In vitro and in vivo testing submitted by Actavis showed KADIAN has a low risk of alcohol-induced dose-dumping, while others (e.g., AVINZA) showed greater risk.

FDA found no scientific evidence or regulatory requirement mandating that bioequivalence studies for topical corticosteroids be conducted in pediatric populations.

The vasoconstrictor assay (Stoughton-McKenzie skin blanching test) used in adults is considered a valid and scientifically acceptable method to establish bioequivalence for topical corticosteroids.

FDA emphasized that the ANDA process does not require new safety or efficacy data, only demonstration of bioequivalence to the RLD (Reference Listed Drug).

Petition's Concerns and FDA’s Rebuttal:

Lack of pediatric-specific data: FDA acknowledged that children may have physiological differences, but stated that bioequivalence demonstrated in adults is sufficient unless specific contrary evidence exists (which Nycomed did not provide).

Vehicle formulation differences: These are evaluated during ANDA review, and the vasoconstrictor assay is sensitive enough to detect differences in drug delivery due to formulation changes.

Pediatric skin differences: FDA found no credible evidence that pediatric skin physiology negates the adult assay’s reliability.

HPA Axis Suppression Risks: The NDA already evaluated safety in pediatric populations. Once the RLD is deemed safe, a bioequivalent generic is assumed to be comparably safe. The vasoconstrictor assay is not meant to assess safety, only bioequivalence.

FDA declined to issue new draft guidance specific to pediatric bioequivalence for topical corticosteroids, stating the 1995 Bioequivalence Guidance remains valid and effective.",denied,True,180.0,CDER,CDER

- Ban on Marketing Practices: Petitioners’ claims that discounting and rebates hinder market entry for safer products lacked supporting evidence. FDA concluded there was insufficient information to determine whether banning such practices would protect public health.

- Tocopherol Regulation: The request for a new rule mandating 300–350 µg Tocopherol per cigarette (as MS-CSC) lacked supporting data or scientific studies. FDA found no evidence that such a standard was necessary to protect public health under Section 907 and ruled rulemaking unwarranted.

Individualized Tapering: Tapering schedules must be tailored to individual patients; no one-size-fits-all approach could be mandated, and the proposed method lacked scientific support.

Boxed Warnings Unjustified: While physical dependence is acknowledged, evidence did not meet the threshold for a boxed warning, which is reserved for risks that may lead to death or serious injury.

a. Lack of New Evidence for Laxation:
- The current petition largely repeated data previously reviewed and rejected.
- Five studies cited for laxation effects were already assessed in the original denial; FDA concluded these studies did not show IMO independently improves laxation, especially given the use of enemas and laxatives during fecal collection periods, which compromised validity.

b. Insufficient Evidence for Blood Cholesterol Benefits:
- Out of five studies cited, three (including the only one conducted on a U.S.-like population) showed no significant impact of IMO on cholesterol levels.
- One study showed a positive result, but it involved hyperlipidemic teenagers, which FDA deemed less relevant.
- Another showed mixed results and used elderly nursing home residents, not representative of the general population.

c. Inconsistency and Lack of Robustness:
- The FDA stated that no plausible explanation reconciled the inconsistency between studies showing benefit and those showing none.
- Studies lacked adequate controls, statistical rigor, or generalizability to the U.S. population.

The petition failed to present adequate information or allegations upon which the FDA could reasonably determine that Abbott did not act with due diligence during the regulatory review period for the Absorb GT1 Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) system
.

Allegations Did Not Relate to Regulatory Review Period:
The claims—including failure to train, anti-competitive behavior, promotional activities, and misconduct—were found not to be directly tied to the regulatory review period or to any delay in submitting the PMA
.

No Demonstrated Link to Approval Delay:
The petition did not establish how any of the alleged actions resulted in a delay in pursuing FDA approval. FDA emphasized that due diligence petitions are not designed to review every alleged misstep, but to determine whether the applicant failed to diligently pursue approval during a defined regulatory period
.

Certification Requirements Not Met:
The petitioner failed to properly certify that a complete copy of the petition was served to the applicant (Abbott) by certified or registered mail, as required by 21 CFR 60.30(d). Instead, it was sent by regular USPS Priority Mail Express, which does not meet the regulation’s requirement",denied,True,92.0,offices,Other/Specialty Center

FDA reaffirmed its 2016 determination that the 60-mg strength of Samsca was not withdrawn due to safety concerns, even though it is listed as “discontinued” in the Orange Book. The product remains part of NDA 022275 and is still eligible to serve as a Reference Listed Drug (RLD)

Updated Labeling with Boxed Warning Was Adequate:
The risk of hepatotoxicity and misuse of Samsca to treat ADPKD was addressed in 2018 through updated labeling. FDA concluded that no further regulatory measures (e.g., withdrawal or REMS) were necessary

ANDA Statutory Framework Satisfied:
FDA clarified that an ANDA applicant does not need to independently demonstrate safety/effectiveness but must rely on the FDA’s findings for the RLD and prove bioequivalence. The agency found no legal reason to refuse or suspend approval of any ANDAs referencing Samsca 60-mg tablets
.

Speculative Concerns Insufficient:
The petition raised hypothetical concerns that Samsca might be used off-label in place of Jynarque (also a tolvaptan product). FDA found no evidence to support that such misuse was occurring or posed sufficient risk to justify regulatory changes

Sufficient Data for Filing:
Lannett submitted sufficient information, including clinical pharmacology, toxicology, and leachables data, to support filing and eventual approval.

No Discriminatory Requirements:

FDA emphasized that it does not require ""perfect alignment"" of datasets across applications, only that the data be sufficient for review. It found no reason to invalidate the filing or approval of Lannett’s application.

Definition of “Application” Does Not Preclude Amendments:
FDA interpreted “application” to include the overall submission and determined that amendments (e.g., updated data or reports) do not constitute a new “application.” Therefore, such updates during the exclusivity period are not barred.

Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity Provisions:
The agency explained that exclusivity provisions are designed to prohibit new submissions that rely on protected data but do not prevent continued review or amendment of previously submitted applications.

Regulatory Consistency and Precedent:
The FDA’s current interpretation aligns with both the 1992 Final Rule and its longstanding regulatory practices, avoiding an interpretation that would prevent any updates to pending NDAs during an exclusivity period.

Avoiding Unreasonable Restriction:
The petitioner’s interpretation would have barred Lannett from correcting deficiencies or improving safety data in its application, thereby undermining public health and the agency’s drug review process.
