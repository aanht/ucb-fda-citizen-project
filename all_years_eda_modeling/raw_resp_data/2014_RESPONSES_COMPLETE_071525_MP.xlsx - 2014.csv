Revised BE Guidance Already Addresses Issues – Since the 2010 draft, FDA reevaluated bioequivalence methods for locally-acting GI drugs and issued a revised draft guidance; petitioner’s requested changes are therefore unnecessary. 2. Adequate BE Pathways Identified – For Q1/Q2-identical generics, dissolution + fed PK (M3 metabolite) tests are sufficient; non-Q1/Q2 products add a CIC clinical-endpoint study. 3. No Need for Additional IBS-C or OIC Studies – Same site/mechanism (ClC-2 channels) allows extrapolation from a single well-designed CIC study; additional trials would expose hundreds of subjects without added scientific value. 4. Safety Profile Concerns Unfounded – Generic sponsors must meet existing formulation-sameness and adverse-event reporting rules; statistical BE limits (80-125 % CI) guard against clinically meaningful exposure differences. 5. Requested Endpoint Change Not Scientifically Superior – Week-1 spontaneous-bowel-movement count is the most sensitive endpoint to detect formulation differences; whole-period SBM frequency adds no precision.

There is also insufficient clinical data to support routine prescreening or to recommend specific dosage adjustments based on screening results.
