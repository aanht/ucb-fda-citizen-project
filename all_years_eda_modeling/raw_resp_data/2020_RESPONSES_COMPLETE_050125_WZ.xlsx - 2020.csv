The remaining requests were denied because they either did not constitute appropriate subjects of a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.25(a) or because creating new procedures for drug reimportation under section 801(d)(2) would not be a prudent use of FDA resources given its limited applicability. The FDA emphasized that existing regulations already address this statutory provision, and future changes, if considered, could be addressed through new petitions."
