Savella (milnacipran hydrochloride) was approved based on two rigorous, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 031 and Study 02).

FDA found the statistical analyses, including the use of composite endpoints and post hoc analysis methods, to be valid and appropriate. The agency explained that the same imputation method for both studies increased data reliability and comparability.

📊 Study Endpoints
Composite endpoints (pain reduction, physical function, and patient global assessment) were deemed suitable due to fibromyalgia being a syndrome with multiple symptoms.

The FDA concluded that statistically significant results were achieved when evaluating these combined endpoints.

💊 Benefit-Risk Profile
FDA stated the benefits of Savella outweigh its risks.

The agency cited updates to product labeling with enhanced safety information and postmarketing safety analyses that supported continued marketing.

🛑 Rebuttal to Petitioner’s Claims
FDA addressed concerns about changing study protocols, exclusion of severely depressed patients, and efficacy thresholds.

The agency rebutted the claim that the benefit was marginal (7–9%) and provided context for interpreting composite endpoint success.

🔍 Safety Monitoring
The agency acknowledged known safety issues, including elevated blood pressure and heart rate, but noted these were class effects typical of SNRIs and managed through updated labeling.",

Key points include:

Insufficient Evidence: Many requests (e.g., for new indications, concomitant use, or claims of relative safety) lacked adequate scientific support. Literature cited did not justify regulatory changes without additional clinical trials (see pages 7–12).

Scientific Standards: Labeling changes require data from sponsors and rigorous review, not just citizen petitions (pages 5, 7, 23).

Population Risk Considerations: The FDA declined to support claims that OTC NRT is broadly safer for all populations (e.g., CVD, pregnancy, adolescents) without clinical validation (pages 16–21).

Regulatory Integrity: Decisions about labeling and indications must be based on well-controlled studies and regulatory standards, not opinion or advocacy alone.

Existing Labeling Already Adequate: Current benzodiazepine labeling already includes warnings for physical dependence, withdrawal, and long-term use. FDA believes these are sufficient for safe use.

Lack of Scientific Basis for 2–4 Week Limit: The requested universal duration limit was deemed overly restrictive and unsupported by clinical data, especially for chronic conditions like generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.

Rejection of “Protracted Withdrawal” Syndrome: The FDA’s literature review did not support the existence of a scientifically recognized ""protracted withdrawal"" syndrome.

Individualized Tapering: Tapering schedules must be tailored to individual patients; no one-size-fits-all approach could be mandated, and the proposed method lacked scientific support.

Boxed Warnings Unjustified: While physical dependence is acknowledged, evidence did not meet the threshold for a boxed warning, which is reserved for risks that may lead to death or serious injury.

No Final Determination on ANDA: FDA had not yet decided whether Paddock’s ANDA would be approved, and therefore was not required to make a premature determination on a specific element of the application (i.e., dosage form) under §505(q)

Procedural Protections: The agency emphasized that ANDA review involves a structured process that includes notifying applicants of deficiencies and allowing them to respond or request hearings. The petition's request to resolve a specific issue outside of that framework was inconsistent with these statutory protections

Interpretation of §505(q): FDA does not interpret §505(q) to require a final decision on isolated technical elements (like dosage form classification) before a complete ANDA review is concluded

Request Was Not to Reverse the Decision: FDA noted that the request essentially asked for elaboration rather than actual reconsideration of its conclusions.

Bioequivalence Determinations Already Justified: The FDA reiterated that its determinations about using pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics (AUC and Cmax) were scientifically valid for evaluating generic mesalamine products.

Scientific Standards: FDA requires bioequivalence through appropriate scientific methods, and agreed with the need for both comparative clinical endpoint studies and in vitro dissolution data to ensure therapeutic equivalence for mesalamine products .

Statutory Discretion: FDA declined to delay ANDA approvals pending guidance publication, explaining that the law does not obligate FDA to issue guidance prior to approval decisions .

In Vivo Waivers: FDA agreed that waivers for in vivo bioequivalence studies between 400 mg and 800 mg tablets should be denied, as they are not directly substitutable due to formulation and dosing differences .

Labeling Decisions: FDA rejected labeling constraints and boxed warning requirements since such determinations must be based on safety and efficacy data evaluated case-by-case for the generic product .

No New Safety or Efficacy Concerns: Despite the change in total strength (from 100 mg to 3000 mg per vial), the dose, route of administration, and usage of the proposed product were identical to the reference listed drug (RLD). FDA determined this change would not raise new safety or effectiveness issues.

No New Clinical Investigations Required: Since the change did not necessitate new studies, and assuming the product meets bioavailability standards, the proposed ANDA product could be expected to have the same therapeutic effect.

FDA determined that Cobrek's resubmission of paragraph IV certifications after reformulating its generic drug product did not constitute an “amendment or withdrawal” that would trigger forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity.

FDA emphasized that reformulation to meet Q1/Q2 equivalence to the reference listed drug does not equate to forfeiting exclusivity. Resubmitting certifications in response to changes in formulation is considered a lawful maintenance of exclusivity rights

b. On Failure to Obtain Tentative Approval (Section 505(j)(5)(D)(i)(IV)):
FDA concluded that Cobrek's failure to obtain tentative approval within 30 months was excused because the reference listed drug (Hectorol) had undergone a formulation change.

This constituted a “change in or review of the requirements for approval,” exempting Cobrek from forfeiture under this provision

c. Conclusion:
Since neither the certification amendments nor the delayed tentative approval met forfeiture conditions, FDA denied Sandoz Inc.’s petition asserting that Cobrek had forfeited 180-day exclusivity.",

- Use of Steady-State Studies in Patients: FDA advocates for multiple-dose, steady-state studies in schizophrenic patients, not single-dose fed/fasted studies, because these patients already take clozapine under real-world conditions. Strict fed or fasting requirements were deemed impractical and risky for this population.

- Labeling of FazaClo: FazaClo labeling indicates it can be taken without regard to meals, supporting that a fed bioequivalence study is unnecessary.

FDA found no scientific evidence or regulatory requirement mandating that bioequivalence studies for topical corticosteroids be conducted in pediatric populations.

The vasoconstrictor assay (Stoughton-McKenzie skin blanching test) used in adults is considered a valid and scientifically acceptable method to establish bioequivalence for topical corticosteroids.

FDA emphasized that the ANDA process does not require new safety or efficacy data, only demonstration of bioequivalence to the RLD (Reference Listed Drug).

Petition's Concerns and FDA’s Rebuttal:

Lack of pediatric-specific data: FDA acknowledged that children may have physiological differences, but stated that bioequivalence demonstrated in adults is sufficient unless specific contrary evidence exists (which Nycomed did not provide).

Vehicle formulation differences: These are evaluated during ANDA review, and the vasoconstrictor assay is sensitive enough to detect differences in drug delivery due to formulation changes.

Pediatric skin differences: FDA found no credible evidence that pediatric skin physiology negates the adult assay’s reliability.

HPA Axis Suppression Risks: The NDA already evaluated safety in pediatric populations. Once the RLD is deemed safe, a bioequivalent generic is assumed to be comparably safe. The vasoconstrictor assay is not meant to assess safety, only bioequivalence.

Request for New Guidance:

FDA declined to issue new draft guidance specific to pediatric bioequivalence for topical corticosteroids, stating the 1995 Bioequivalence Guidance remains valid and effective.",

Timely Paragraph IV Certification and Lawsuit: Roche received Orchid’s Paragraph IV certification notice for U.S. Patent No. 4,927,814 on July 26, 2010, and initiated a patent infringement suit within 45 days. This satisfied the legal conditions under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) for a 30-month stay of ANDA approval.

Patent Was Listed Before ANDA Filing: The '814 patent had been properly submitted for listing in the Orange Book prior to Orchid’s ANDA submission, satisfying the prerequisite for a stay.

FDA Policy on Certification Conversion: FDA supports a 30-month stay when a Paragraph III certification is converted to a Paragraph IV and litigation is timely filed.

Limit on Stay Duration: FDA clarified that the stay would terminate upon patent expiration (March 17, 2012), in accordance with policy and precedent.

Rebuttal to Orchid's Arguments: FDA rejected Orchid’s counterclaims that:

Delay must be justified on public health grounds,

The 7.5-year exclusivity under §505(j)(5)(F)(ii) overrides 30-month stay provisions,

Draft Guidance and court decisions like Teva v. Sebelius negate the stay,

Roche’s update to patent info post-ANDA filing invalidated the stay.",

- Insufficient Clinical Evidence: The petition failed to demonstrate that Auralgan is “Generally Recognized As Safe and Effective” (GRAS/E) through adequate and well-controlled studies.
- Product Variability: The formulation of Auralgan referenced was not consistent across cited studies, and differences in active ingredients and concentrations weakened claims of GRAS/E status.
- Disqualification of Supporting Evidence: Many cited studies lacked control groups or failed to meet FDA standards for clinical adequacy.
- Legal Interpretation: The FDA interpreted the FD&C Act to mean that each product as a whole—not just its components—must be shown to be GRAS/E.
- Prior Enforcement Actions: FDA had already seized unapproved Auralgan products and enforced compliance with new drug application (NDA) requirements.
- Procedural Grounds: Requests to allow marketing pending NDA approval or to halt enforcement were denied under 21 CFR 10.30 and 10.35 as procedurally unsupported.",

- Cmin Importance Acknowledged: FDA agreed Cmin is important for therapeutic efficacy, especially for heart failure patients, but noted that reliable estimation can be done through modeling based on single-dose studies rather than requiring multiple-dose studies.

- Use of Simulation: FDA used physiologically based PK modeling to determine that equivalence in AUC and Cmax from single-dose studies can predict equivalent Cmin at steady state.

- Precedent from Coreg CR Approval: FDA did not apply strict pass/fail statistical criteria to Cmin in the original Coreg CR NDA (some strengths were outside 80–125% range).

- Alcohol Dose Dumping: The request for mandatory clinical testing to rule out alcohol-induced dose dumping was denied, with FDA stating that in vitro ethanol dissolution testing was sufficient.

1. Safety of sedation: CDRH cited a “serious safety signal” due to increased incidence of deeper-than-intended sedation in the SEDASYS group (including general anesthesia in 5 patients), versus the control group (1 patient).
2. Appropriateness of control arm: CDRH challenged the trial design, arguing it should have compared SEDASYS-assisted propofol administration by gastroenterologists to propofol given by anesthesia-trained personnel, not to benzodiazepine/opioid sedation.
- CDRH also questioned the adequacy of the proposed training program, stating it was not validated by outcome-based clinical studies.

• No patients experienced apnea or oxygen desaturation
• Safety features of the device mitigated risks
• Trial design reflected real-world “standard of care” practices

• Inclusion of useful factual background
• Structuring committee questions for clarity (yes/no format)
• Focus on scientific/clinical rather than regulatory issues
• Ensuring questions address the specific bases for the CDRH denial of the PMA

- CDRH's denial was based on two main concerns:
1. Safety concerns – SEDASYS showed an increased incidence of deeper-than-intended sedation (including general anesthesia), which CDRH deemed a ""serious safety signal."" EES argued those incidents were not clinically significant as no apnea or desaturation occurred, and the system includes safety controls
.
2. Study design limitations – CDRH found the control arm in the pivotal study inappropriate and objected to EES’s proposed training program due to lack of validation in an outcome-based study. EES defended both the comparator and the training based on investigator experience in the pivotal trial
.
- The summary includes six specific questions to guide the Advisory Committee’s discussion on safety, comparator appropriateness, and training mitigation",
