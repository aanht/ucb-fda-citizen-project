As stated in both the opening paragraph (page 1) and the conclusion (page 16):

Granted: FDA will require ANDA applicants to measure both oxybutynin and its active metabolite desethyloxybutynin in fasting and fed conditions.

Denied: FDA will not require application of standard bioequivalence criteria to:

Fisons Corp. v. Shalala, 860 F. Supp. 859 (D.D.C. 1994)","Bioequivalence Evaluation Approach:

The parent drug (oxybutynin) is more sensitive to formulation changes than its metabolite.

Measuring the metabolite (desethyloxybutynin) provides supportive evidence but applying full bioequivalence statistical criteria to it is unnecessary and inconsistent with FDA guidance.

On Fasting vs. Fed Conditions:

FDA agrees that food may affect the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin differently.

Therefore, it requires ANDA applicants to demonstrate bioequivalence under both conditions.

On Enantiomers (R/S Forms):

FDA concludes that Ditropan XL fails to meet the four criteria for requiring separate measurement of R- and S-enantiomers:

Although enantiomers differ pharmacologically and pharmacokinetically,

Primary efficacy/safety does not reside with the minor enantiomer,

There is no evidence of nonlinear absorption,

No validated model or human study demonstrates the clinical significance of such differences.

FDA finds that measuring the racemic mixture is sufficient for regulatory purposes.

On Delivery System Concerns:

No persuasive evidence was presented to show that different extended-release (ER) technologies would result in clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy among generic products.",From 2006?

Guidance for Industry on Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products—General Considerations

FDA's Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations","Bioequivalence Between Strengths Not Required:
FDA determined that a generic applicant does not need to show bioequivalence between five 20-mg tablets and one 100-mg Arava tablet. They only need to demonstrate bioequivalence for each strength individually compared to the corresponding Reference Listed Drug (RLD).

100-mg Tablet Not Required in Generic Product Line:
Generic manufacturers are not obligated to include a 100-mg strength if they demonstrate bioequivalence for the 10-mg or 20-mg strengths. Labeling can still refer to a 100-mg tablet, including Arava's, to satisfy loading dose instructions.

Labeling Considerations:
The FDA allows ANDA labeling to include references to strengths the generic manufacturer does not produce, such as the 100-mg loading dose. This is supported by regulatory precedent and labeling practices for other drugs like Videx and Oncaspar.

No Safety or Efficacy Risk Identified:
FDA concluded that referencing a 100-mg loading dose tablet in generic labeling (even if not produced by the generic sponsor) would not compromise safety or efficacy. Therefore, a bioequivalence study comparing 5x20 mg to 1x100 mg was deemed unnecessary.

Regulatory Precedent:
The FDA cited multiple examples of approved generics not offering every RLD strength, reinforcing the legal and regulatory basis for denying the petition.",from 2005?

Citations are concentrated on page 3 in the section discussing labeling regulations and professional qualifications","Propofol Has Unique and Serious Risks:
The FDA emphasized that propofol poses greater risks than alternative sedation agents, including sudden onset of respiratory and cardiovascular depression, and has no reversal agent.

Warning Aligns with Standards of Medical Safety:
The warning in question reflects concerns outlined by major medical bodies including JCAHO, ASA, and the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities. It ensures propofol is administered by individuals trained in general anesthesia and solely focused on monitoring the patient—not performing procedures simultaneously.

Studies Submitted Were Insufficient:
The FDA reviewed 31 publications submitted with the petition and concluded they lacked adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials proving that propofol can be safely administered by gastroenterologists or nurses without anesthesia training. Some studies even showed higher complication rates when administered by non-anesthesia personnel.

Economic and Practice Concerns Don’t Justify Risk:
Cost savings and expanded scope of practice for gastroenterologists were deemed insufficient to outweigh the safety risks of changing the labeling. FDA reaffirmed that labeling does not restrict practice by specialty but sets standards for safety and competence.",from 2010?

The FDA found that it had applied the same filing standards to both Genus's and Lannett's applications for cocaine HCl nasal solution. Both companies were required to provide equivalent types of data, though each chose different approaches (e.g., literature-based vs. dedicated clinical studies).

Sufficient Data for Filing:
Lannett submitted sufficient information, including clinical pharmacology, toxicology, and leachables data, to support filing and eventual approval. FDA determined that the studies provided were adequate for substantive review and that additional studies—though different from Genus's—were not legally required.

No Discriminatory Requirements:
The FDA explicitly rejected the claim that it unfairly imposed more demanding requirements on Genus. It clarified that applicants have flexibility in how they fulfill filing requirements and that Genus had the option to rely on literature or alternative data sources like Lannett did.

Scientific and Regulatory Sufficiency:
FDA emphasized that it does not require ""perfect alignment"" of datasets across applications, only that the data be sufficient for review. It found no reason to invalidate the filing or approval of Lannett’s application.

No Legal Obligation to Delay Lannett’s NDA:
The agency disagreed with Genus’s interpretation of 505(c)(3)(E)(ii) exclusivity protections. It asserted that Lannett’s NDA was permissible under applicable rules and did not violate exclusivity provisions.",

The protected information regarding the reduced incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction (TESD) from new clinical trials (Study 10 and Study 11) was deemed to fall under three-year exclusivity protections. Thus, it could not be used in labeling for generic versions .

Omission Does Not Render Product Less Safe or Effective:
FDA concluded that removing this protected information from the generic labeling would not make the generic vortioxetine product less safe or effective for the remaining, non-protected uses .

Treatment Adherence Argument Not Supported:
Petitioners argued that the protected information would improve treatment adherence. FDA rejected this, stating there was no supporting clinical evidence that the omission would negatively affect adherence .

FDA Precedent and Carve-Outs Valid:
FDA affirmed its authority and precedent to approve generic products with carve-outs for protected labeling content, as long as the generic remains safe and effective for its approved indications .

No Misleading Labeling:

1989 Proposed Rule, 54 FR 28872 (July 10, 1989)","Amendments to Pending NDAs Allowed Without Violating Exclusivity:
The agency concluded that Lannett could lawfully continue submitting amendments to its previously filed 505(b)(2) application—even during the exclusivity period of Genus's Goprelto—as long as the amendments did not rely on a published investigation conducted by or for Genus without a right of reference.

Definition of “Application” Does Not Preclude Amendments:
FDA interpreted “application” to include the overall submission and determined that amendments (e.g., updated data or reports) do not constitute a new “application.” Therefore, such updates during the exclusivity period are not barred.

Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity Provisions:
The agency explained that exclusivity provisions are designed to prohibit new submissions that rely on protected data but do not prevent continued review or amendment of previously submitted applications.

Regulatory Consistency and Precedent:
The FDA’s current interpretation aligns with both the 1992 Final Rule and its longstanding regulatory practices, avoiding an interpretation that would prevent any updates to pending NDAs during an exclusivity period.

Avoiding Unreasonable Restriction:
The petitioner’s interpretation would have barred Lannett from correcting deficiencies or improving safety data in its application, thereby undermining public health and the agency’s drug review process. FDA found this position both impractical and unsupported by statute or regulation",

FDA concluded that the petitioner did not provide adequate scientific evidence to demonstrate that IMO consumption has a beneficial physiological effect—specifically, in relation to laxation or blood cholesterol levels, the two endpoints evaluated.

Studies Were Methodologically Limited:
Studies submitted suffered from issues such as:

Inadequate statistical analysis

Insufficient control of confounding variables

Use of laxative/enema treatments during collection periods, which compromised laxation assessments

Small sample sizes and poorly controlled study designs

Lack of Demonstrated Relevance to Target Populations:
FDA found that studies conducted on chronically constipated patients could not be extrapolated to the general healthy population, limiting the relevance of claimed benefits
.

IMO’s Chemical Structure Alone Not Sufficient for Classification:
Although IMO may share similar non-digestible carbohydrate linkages with other fibers like inulin and GOS, FDA clarified that structure alone is not sufficient for dietary fiber classification without demonstrated health benefits.

Final Statement:
The agency indicated it is open to a new petition if future evidence demonstrates a health benefit from IMO consumption.",

The petitioner claimed gum acacia had beneficial effects on (1) postprandial blood glucose and insulin and (2) energy intake and satiety. FDA concluded the total body of evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a beneficial physiological effect
.

Weaknesses in Cited Studies:
Many studies lacked appropriate controls, included mixed fiber interventions, or did not report outcomes in a statistically robust manner. In particular:

Five of nine blood glucose/insulin studies had significant design limitations.

Of four interpretable studies, results were inconsistent—only some showed benefits, and those often lacked dose-response relationships.

Inconsistent Results on Energy Intake:
Of the three interpretable energy intake studies:

One showed a statistically significant effect at 40 g dose only.

Another showed benefit at 5–10 g doses.

A third (Larson et al., 2019) showed no significant effect.
FDA concluded these inconsistencies undermined confidence in gum acacia’s efficacy.

No Plausible Explanation for Mixed Results:
FDA could not determine whether observed inconsistencies were due to study design, population, or measurement errors. Thus, no reliable conclusion could be drawn regarding gum acacia’s physiological benefits.

Conclusion:
Due to limited, inconsistent, and inconclusive evidence, gum acacia was not deemed eligible for inclusion as a dietary fiber under the regulatory definition.",

FDA reaffirmed its 2016 determination that the 60-mg strength of Samsca was not withdrawn due to safety concerns, even though it is listed as “discontinued” in the Orange Book. The product remains part of NDA 022275 and is still eligible to serve as a Reference Listed Drug (RLD)
.

Updated Labeling with Boxed Warning Was Adequate:
The risk of hepatotoxicity and misuse of Samsca to treat ADPKD was addressed in 2018 through updated labeling. FDA concluded that no further regulatory measures (e.g., withdrawal or REMS) were necessary
.

ANDA Statutory Framework Satisfied:
FDA clarified that an ANDA applicant does not need to independently demonstrate safety/effectiveness but must rely on the FDA’s findings for the RLD and prove bioequivalence. The agency found no legal reason to refuse or suspend approval of any ANDAs referencing Samsca 60-mg tablets
.

Speculative Concerns Insufficient:
The petition raised hypothetical concerns that Samsca might be used off-label in place of Jynarque (also a tolvaptan product). FDA found no evidence to support that such misuse was occurring or posed sufficient risk to justify regulatory changes
.

Comparison to Palladone and OxyContin Not Persuasive:
FDA distinguished the case of Samsca from withdrawals of other drugs like Palladone and OxyContin, emphasizing that those drugs posed direct public health threats that were not present in the case of Samsca

Structured Approach to Benefit-Risk Assessment in Drug Regulatory Decision Making (PDUFA V Implementation Plan, 2013–2017)","Not Legally Required to Issue Product-Specific Guidance:
FDA emphasized that it is not legally obligated to issue product-specific guidance documents to approve NDAs or ANDAs. Guidance is non-binding and represents the agency’s current thinking, not enforceable mandates
.

Flexibility in Scientific Judgment:
The agency applies general statutory standards flexibly across different drug types and exercises scientific discretion to determine the sufficiency of evidence required for approval
.

Consistent Standards Already Applied:
The FDA rejected the claim that oral testosterone-ester (T-ester) products lack consistent standards, stating that it has already applied clear, consistent efficacy and safety expectations to T replacement therapies—including Jatenzo (approved March 2019)
.

Denial of Blanket Approval/Denial Requests:
The agency refused to grant a request to codify approval criteria into binding guidance and declined to deny or approve any pending applications based on the petition’s proposed standards. Each application is assessed individually under existing laws and regulations
.

Statutory Review Framework Exists:
The FD&C Act and FDA regulations already provide procedural protections and a framework to evaluate NDAs/ANDAs. The agency cannot bypass this system through a citizen petition
.

Timing Constraints Under Section 505(q):
FDA clarified it must respond to the petition within 150 days but is not required to issue decisions on the approvability of other pending applications within that window",

The product Bentyl (dicyclomine hydrochloride tablets, 20 mg), previously approved under NDA 007409, was no longer available on the market despite not being listed as discontinued in the Orange Book. This unavailability was confirmed via FDA’s Drug Shortages Database
.

Inability to Proceed with Generic Development:
Both petitioners (Aurobindo and IQVIA) indicated that the absence of an available reference standard hindered their ability to proceed with generic ANDA submissions
.

Commercial Data Supported Market Unavailability:
Market share data and commercial availability were reviewed, reinforcing that the existing reference product was unavailable for conducting bioequivalence studies
.

Selection of Therapeutic Equivalent Product:
Based on commercial availability and therapeutic equivalence, FDA determined that ANDA 085223, held by Watson Laboratories Inc., met the necessary criteria. It is:

Currently marketed

Therapeutically equivalent

Identified as a suitable replacement reference standard
.

Regulatory Compliance:
FDA affirmed that selecting a new reference standard in this case aligns with regulatory requirements and precedent when the listed drug is unavailable",

The FDA confirmed that Bentyl (dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules, 10 mg), the previously selected reference standard, was not commercially available based on commercial and regulatory filings and third-party data
.

Petitioners Requested Alternative Reference Standard:
Both Aurobindo and Hyman, Phelps & McNamara (HPM) requested FDA select a new reference standard due to the lack of market availability of Bentyl
.

FDA Selected Therapeutic Equivalent Product:
After review, FDA chose ANDA 084285 (held by Lannett Co. Inc.) as the new reference standard because:

It is therapeutically equivalent to Bentyl (as per Orange Book's AB code)

It is currently the market leader in the U.S.

It meets regulatory standards for use in bioequivalence testing
.

Agency Discretion to Designate Reference Standard:
FDA highlighted its authority to choose a new reference standard when the RLD is discontinued, as long as the replacement is therapeutically equivalent and currently marketed",

The petitioner (Unichem Pharmaceuticals) did not provide data suggesting that the drug was withdrawn for safety or effectiveness concerns. FDA’s internal review of records and adverse event data also revealed no indication of such withdrawal rationale
.

Independent Review of Literature and Postmarketing Data:
FDA conducted an independent review of scientific literature and postmarketing safety data, finding no adverse safety signals associated with the product’s withdrawal
.

Regulatory Path Remains Open:
Because the product’s withdrawal from marketing was not for safety or effectiveness, the drug remains listed in the Orange Book’s “Discontinued Drug Product List.” FDA will continue to approve ANDAs referencing this drug, provided regulatory requirements are met
.

Historical Precedent Under 1984 Amendments:
FDA reiterated that under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, such determinations are essential to allow generics referencing previously approved drugs to proceed without repeating full clinical trials",

The petition asked FDA to remove Patent No. 8,188,146 from the Orange Book. However, such a request is subject to the patent listing dispute procedures outlined in 21 CFR § 314.53(f). The citizen petition format used by the petitioner does not comply with those specific procedural requirements
.

Ministerial Role of FDA in Patent Listings:
FDA reiterated that it does not evaluate or challenge the validity or accuracy of patent submissions made by NDA holders via Form FDA 3542. The FDA’s role is limited to ministerial publication of that information in the Orange Book
.

Process for Challenging Listings Exists:
A structured pathway is provided in § 314.53(f) that allows third parties to file a “314.53(f) Patent Listing Dispute”, but the citizen petition process is not the correct mechanism for such a challenge
.

No Change Without NDA Holder Action:
FDA cannot amend, withdraw, or correct patent information unless the NDA holder voluntarily revises it, even if a third party contests it
.

Opportunity to Refile via Correct Procedure:
FDA acknowledged that while the citizen petition is denied, the petitioner remains free to submit a properly formatted dispute per § 314.53(f) to Orange Book Staff",

- Insulin resistance alone is not sufficient for predicting diabetes risk unless combined with prediabetes markers.
- Acceptable diagnostic tests include OGTT, HbA1c, and FPG, but must follow ADA-recommended thresholds.

- The current petition largely repeated data previously reviewed and rejected.
- Five studies cited for laxation effects were already assessed in the original denial; FDA concluded these studies did not show IMO independently improves laxation, especially given the use of enemas and laxatives during fecal collection periods, which compromised validity.

b. Insufficient Evidence for Blood Cholesterol Benefits:
- Out of five studies cited, three (including the only one conducted on a U.S.-like population) showed no significant impact of IMO on cholesterol levels.
- One study showed a positive result, but it involved hyperlipidemic teenagers, which FDA deemed less relevant.
- Another showed mixed results and used elderly nursing home residents, not representative of the general population.

c. Inconsistency and Lack of Robustness:
- The FDA stated that no plausible explanation reconciled the inconsistency between studies showing benefit and those showing none.
- Studies lacked adequate controls, statistical rigor, or generalizability to the U.S. population.

","Other (Scientific Consultation)

This document is a scientific consultation rather than a formal approval/denial of a petition. It provides clinical guidance on diagnostic criteria and surrogate endpoints for evaluating qualified health claims related to type 2 diabetes.","No specific U.S. statutes or regulations (e.g., CFR or FD&C Act) are directly cited.

However, the following guidances and standards are referenced:

FDA’s 2009 Guidance for Industry: Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims
(Link).

American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes – 2022.","The FDA (CDER/DDLO) provides extensive scientific rationale in response to CFSAN’s request, including:
Diagnostic Criteria for Type 2 Diabetes:
Diagnosis is based on ADA standards:
Fasting Plasma Glucose ≥126 mg/dL
2-hour OGTT ≥200 mg/dL
HbA1c ≥6.5%
Random glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms
In absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, two abnormal tests are required

Surrogate Endpoints for Risk of Type 2 Diabetes:
Valid and accurate surrogate endpoints include:
Impaired fasting glucose: 100–125 mg/dL
Impaired glucose tolerance: 140–199 mg/dL during OGTT
HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%
Insulin resistance alone is not recommended as an independent surrogate endpoint unless accompanied by prediabetic glucose levels

On Study Duration:
“Acute” studies (exposures <1 day) are too short to draw meaningful conclusions regarding type 2 diabetes risk.
A study duration of at least 3 weeks is suggested for assessing interventions affecting surrogate endpoints like glucose or HbA1c",sceintific consultation
