FDA explained that requests for enforcement action are within the Agency’s discretion and not within the scope of citizen petition procedures. Such decisions are handled case-by-case and do not fall under the citizen petition process.  FDA noted that although the petition was denied, the information submitted was helpful and that the Agency would evaluate the matter further to determine whether follow-up is appropriate"

FDA reviewed both the submitted evidence and new data, particularly from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) trial. DAPT trial showed extended therapy (>12 months) had benefits for certain patients, with outcomes dependent on individual thrombotic and bleeding risks (pages 3–4). 2016 ACC/AHA Guidelines advise case-by-case consideration rather than blanket warnings (page 4). FDA concluded that a boxed warning for clopidogrel use beyond 12 months after stent insertion would be inconsistent with current scientific data (page 4)."

FDA concluded that developing class-wide labeling for OTC PPIs or mandating uniform labeling based on Prilosec OTC would be inconsistent with its standard review process. Labeling is approved based on data submitted for individual NDAs. Consumer confusion concerns were acknowledged but addressed by FDA's case-by-case evaluation policy. FDA already imposed comparable standards on Nexium 24HR as on Prilosec OTC, fulfilling the petitioner's request. FDA cannot approve labeling that is false or misleading and must be substantiated by adequate data.

The agency concluded that additional bioequivalence testing based on metabolites was unnecessary and that the labeling concerns raised did not justify changing current standards for the approval of generic versions of the drug.

The FDA found the requested clinical endpoint bioequivalence study unnecessary, as pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and in vitro comparisons were deemed sufficient for mesalamine rectal suppositories. The agency rejected the claim that differences in healthy vs. diseased patients or the need for different bioequivalence guidance were substantiated by evidence. They determined the requested hold on ANDA approvals lacked scientific basis. The 2013 Bioequivalence Guidance was considered appropriate and based on current science"

The agency found no need for additional metabolite-based bioequivalence studies or additional restrictions, concluding that the current standards adequately ensure generic drug safety and effectiveness.

The FDA concluded that Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) can be potentially life-threatening if not recognized and treated, justifying warnings. FDA relied on scientific studies (e.g., the “Patrick study”) showing increased NAS diagnosis and hospitalizations, validating the labeling changes. The proposed alternative language by petitioners was considered less informative or misleading regarding NOWS risks. The petitioners’ claims that NOWS is not life-threatening and not associated with adverse outcomes were not supported by sufficient evidence.

The agency determined that additional metabolite-based bioequivalence studies and labeling restrictions were not necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of generic products.

The FDA concluded that Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) is potentially life-threatening if not recognized and treated, supporting the necessity of new labeling warnings. The Patrick study and other data demonstrated a significant rise in NAS (including NOWS) cases and correlated opioid use during pregnancy, validating the labeling updates. Petitioners' proposals to modify or replace NOWS language in the ER/LA opioid analgesics labeling were rejected as inconsistent with available scientific and medical evidence. The FDA emphasized the importance of highlighting risk while ensuring proper clinical use of opioids during pregnancy. The FDA determined that no advisory committee review was warranted."

The agency determined that requiring additional bioequivalence studies based on metabolites or imposing further labeling restrictions was unnecessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of generic drug products.

The FDA determined that the protected labeling information regarding the administration of IV treprostinil with high pH glycine diluent was not necessary for the safe or effective use of generic products. The agency concluded that omitting such information would not render a generic product less safe or effective than the reference listed drug (RLD), Remodulin. Supporting studies (e.g., Zaccardelli and Rich) were deemed suggestive but not conclusive of superior safety of high pH diluents. The FDA emphasized that carve-out of protected labeling is legally permissible under FD&C Act and cited precedent (e.g., Colcrys decision)."
