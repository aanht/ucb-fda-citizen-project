The use of 'mcg' arose from medical field concerns about handwritten errors but is misapplied to printed labeling in nutrition and other non-medical contexts.

FDA-2020-P-2353-0001_Citizen_Petition_from_UCSF_Senate_Emeritus_Medicin.pdf,"December 23, 2020","Meg D. Newman, MD, UCSF Senate Emeritus-Department of Medicine","No, the petition was submitted by Dr. Meg D. Newman on her own behalf as a physician and former patient, not on behalf of another entity",21 C.F.R. 10.30; 21 C.F.R. 25.30,FDA’s potential requirement of additional placebo-controlled trials for live microbiome-based treatments for the prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI),Consider the existing data on live microbiome-based treatments for prevention of recurrent CDI sufficient for approval. 2. Refrain from requiring additional placebo-controlled trials for these treatments.,"Dr. Newman cites robust efficacy and safety data from three separate Phase III clinical trials of live microbiome-based therapies (from Rebiotix/Ferring, Finch Therapeutics, and Seres Therapeutics). She also references supporting literature on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), arguing these establish a strong case for clinical benefit. Requiring further placebo-controlled trials would unnecessarily delay access to effective treatment, increase morbidity and mortality, and violate ethical standards, as clinical equipoise no longer exists for such trials. She urges the FDA to expedite availability of these therapies based on current evidence."

They provide five human studies showing statistically significant reductions in these biomarkers following GA consumption. The petition includes new data from a 2020 study and notes that gum acacia is already recognized in other FDA contexts as a dietary fiber or safe food additive."

Despite recognizing that euthanized animals may introduce pentobarbital into pet food through rendering, FDA has maintained a position of enforcement discretion. The petitioner requests a formal regulation to resolve this contradiction and uphold food safety standards under proper rulemaking procedures"
