Remove all unapproved lidocaine patch products from the market.
2. Apply strictly the NDA/ANDA and OTC-monograph provisions to lidocaine patches marketed after 1972.
3. Finalize the External Analgesics TFM (explicitly excluding patches).
4. Issue immediate enforcement-policy guidance stating such patches are violative.
5. Monitor listings/marketplace and take ongoing administrative or judicial action against violators.","Safety risks: Patch dosage forms can deliver unpredictable systemic lidocaine levels, especially with heat, exercise, large sizes, or high residual drug, posing risks such as methemoglobinemia and cardiotoxicity.
- Efficacy uncertainty: No data show OTC patches formulated at ≤ 4 % provide reliable pain relief; adhesion and drug-delivery performance are untested.
- Regulatory gap: Patches were never evaluated in the OTC review; FDA itself proposed excluding them in 2003, yet they proliferate under a “monograph” guise.
- Labeling & ingredient concerns: Current products omit warnings, use unqualified excipients, and may lack child-resistant packaging, leading to misbranding and exposure hazards.",

• Local site of action, low permeability & high PK variability mean plasma PK cannot assure bioequivalence; only clinical-endpoint studies suffice.
• Polymorphic form matters: Form Alpha was chosen for stability and low solubility; other forms could alter dissolution, efficacy, or abuse potential.
• Controlled-substance risk: Using a different polymorph or excipient profile could increase extraction, intranasal use, or diversion; therefore FDA must review abuse data or require an Eight-Factor analysis.",

• Xellia’s and Baxter’s Vancomycin Injection products are pharmaceutical equivalents (identical strength, dosage form “solution,” and IV route).

3. High prescribing volume: Tramadol became one of the most prescribed opioids in the U.S. after hydrocodone’s 2014 rescheduling.
4. Misuse data: National Survey data show more people misuse tramadol than many Schedule II drugs, including morphine and fentanyl.
5. Increased mortality: Post-2014 studies show elevated mortality risks tied to tramadol use.

""Dairy cheese contains reproductive hormones that may increase breast cancer mortality risk.""","Scientific studies indicate a strong correlation between consumption of high-fat dairy (including cheese) and increased breast cancer risk and mortality.

- Post-diagnosis consumption of high-fat dairy is also associated with 49% higher mortality.
- Public should be warned of these risks through product labeling to promote informed choices",
