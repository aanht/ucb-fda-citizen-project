- The petition requested additional bioequivalence (BE), chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC), and stability requirements to ensure generic product safety and therapeutic equivalence.

- Pohl argues that Perrigo's market entry without addressing these concerns would result in irreparable commercial harm and potential patient risk due to insufficient therapeutic equivalence.
- Public interest supports the petition, emphasizing the importance of prompt and transparent agency decision-making, and safety of patients relying on rapid-onset drugs for angina",,

FDA precedent: For initial approval of Coreg CR, FDA required its Cmin to be at least as high as Coreg IR and the trough-to-peak ratio to remain comparable. Flamel argues this precedent must apply to generics as well.

Risk of alcohol-induced dose dumping: GSK demonstrated that Coreg CR is not vulnerable to dose dumping, but generic versions may use different drug delivery technologies which may not be resistant to alcohol.

Risks are highest between 6 AM and Noon, when drug levels may be lowest.

FDA Precedent: FDA previously required Cmin in Coreg CR’s approval (comparison to Coreg IR), establishing a regulatory standard that should also apply to generics.

Bioequivalence Limitations: Traditional 80–125% ranges for bioequivalence are not sufficient. Petitioners propose that Cmin must be ≥100% of the innovator’s level.
