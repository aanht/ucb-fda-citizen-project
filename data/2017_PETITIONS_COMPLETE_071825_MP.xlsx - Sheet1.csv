• Required medical, genetic, and social updates
• Electronic health record-keeping
• Ban on anonymous donation
• Centralized databank tracking donors, recipients, and births","The petition outlines that the U.S. cryobank industry is a multibillion-dollar, largely unregulated sector, leading to:
• Inconsistent medical/genetic screening standards
• Insufficient communication of critical health data
• Donor fraud and identity falsification
• Psychological and health risks to donor-conceived children
