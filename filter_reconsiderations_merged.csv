- FDA thoroughly evaluated multiple sources: citizen petitions, docket comments, marketing status notifications, communications with applicants, annual reports (which were missing), and third-party commercial data.
- FDA found conflicting and incomplete information from Atnahs and no persuasive evidence that Naprosyn was available in sufficient quantities for use as a reference standard.
- The agency emphasized that ensuring availability of a reference standard is in the public interest and rejected the petition based on both regulatory grounds and public policy considerations.
- Reconsideration was also denied on discretionary grounds, as it was not found to be in the public interest or interest of justice"

- FDA denied the request because:
  • There is already a legal framework under the FD&C Act that prohibits marketing of unapproved new OTC drugs containing marijuana or THC.
  • No NDA or ANDA has been approved for OTC products containing marijuana or THC, and no such products have been found to be GRAS/E (Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective).
  • FDA does not need to restate these enforcement authorities in a new negative monograph.
  • Enforcement and regulatory tools already exist regardless of whether a negative monograph is issued.
  • IND and DEA registration requirements are already well established and codified; restating them is unnecessary.
- FDA emphasized limited agency resources and the sufficiency of existing statutory and regulatory tools

• Marijuana and THC are widely marketed OTC under state laws for unapproved medical uses with false and misleading therapeutic claims.
• Current FDA enforcement (e.g., only 4 CBD warning letters issued in 2017 out of 15,318 total) is insufficient and ineffective.
• Negative monographs are effective regulatory tools, previously used for less harmful drugs (e.g., OTC sedatives).
• Marijuana poses serious public health risks, including those noted in reports by the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis.
• Cites evidence of adverse outcomes from cannabis, such as prenatal harm, genotoxicity, and increased youth use in legalized states.
• A negative monograph would streamline FDA enforcement and help consumers recognize the lack of proven safety/efficacy.
