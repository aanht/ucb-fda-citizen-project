Specifically, minimal FDA-mandated medical testing for sperm and egg donors and the broader absence of national regulatory oversight.","The petitioner asks the FDA Commissioner to investigate the current state of the sperm donation industry and develop appropriate regulations and oversight mechanisms. Key regulatory proposals include:
• Standardized and expanded pre-conception testing
• Mandated full genome sequencing
• Required medical, genetic, and social updates
• Electronic health record-keeping
• Ban on anonymous donation
• Centralized databank tracking donors, recipients, and births","The petition outlines that the U.S. cryobank industry is a multibillion-dollar, largely unregulated sector, leading to:
• Inconsistent medical/genetic screening standards
• Insufficient communication of critical health data
• Donor fraud and identity falsification
• Psychological and health risks to donor-conceived children
• Inadequate recordkeeping, enabling excessive offspring numbers per donor and risk of consanguinity.

- Many of the requested regulations focus on genetic diseases, which do not qualify as ""communicable diseases"" under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, and therefore fall outside the FDA’s statutory authority.
- Existing regulations already address communicable disease testing for HCT/Ps (human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products).
- Requests for broader tracking, electronic recordkeeping, and banning anonymous donation were declined due to lack of direct relevance to communicable disease prevention, privacy concerns, and impracticality/burden on tissue establishments.
- The FDA also emphasized that existing regulations already require extensive record retention and labeling for communicable disease risks, and further expansion was not warranted at this time."

- Conclusion: As the petition requested the FDA to forgo enforcement under specific labeling conditions for raw milk, it was not a request the FDA could consider under its citizen petition rules, and thus it was denied

- Genzyme failed to act with due diligence, citing several delays and missteps throughout the regulatory review period.
- University of Michigan scientists and NIH funding were primarily responsible for the original invention and development of Cerdelga. Genzyme merely licensed and optimized the molecule, conducting limited clinical trials (with 186 total patients).
- Genzyme's incentives to delay development were financial—prolonging the regulatory review period increases the possible length of the patent extension.
- Cerdelga’s high cost ($300,000+/year) contributes to public burden and limits access to treatment.

","The petitioner presents a detailed rationale, including:
